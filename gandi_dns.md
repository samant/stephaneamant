# How to set up DNS records on gandi.net to use a custom domain on Github Pages

> You would think it would be easy to find this information, but none of the Github or Gandi documentation is clear so I have recorded the required steps here.

Create the following A records:

```
@ 1800 IN A 185.199.108.153
@ 1800 IN A 185.199.109.153
@ 1800 IN A 185.199.110.153
@ 1800 IN A 185.199.111.153
```

Remove the Gandi parking page A record:

```
@ 10800 IN A 217.70.184.38
```

Create the following CNAME record:

```
www 10800 IN CNAME [github-username].github.io.
```

Remove the Gandi parking page CNAME record:

```
www 1800 IN CNAME webredir.vip.gandi.net.
```

Finally, in your Github repo create a file called `CNAME` which contains your Gandi domain name, e.g. `[my-domain].io`.
