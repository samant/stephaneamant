[RESUME](/cv_stephane_amant_en_2019.pdf)

If my job had only one purpose, it will be to improve process, business or in a simpler way life by providing better tools! Tools tailored to answer a proper problem while keeping certain strength such as good application design allowing cost's drop via easiest and fastest development, reliability, efficiency, better reusability and maintainability.

I like to work in team, driven by goals using my analytical mind. At the end, what I most enjoy is to see these solutions put in place where they belong.

Finally I could say that Iâ€™m a technology enthusiast! Curious of everything and passionated by learning and sharing knowledge!
